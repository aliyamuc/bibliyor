Title: SaaMES: SaaS-Based MSA/MTA Model for Real-Time Control of IoT Edge Devices in Digital Manufacturing
Abstract:
This paper proposes SaaMES, a Software as a Service (SaaS) based Manufacturing Execution System (MES) model that incorporates Microservice Architecture (MSA) and Multi-tenancy Architecture (MTA) for real-time control of IoT Edge devices in digital manufacturing. The model aims to address limitations of traditional on-premise MES systems and leverage the benefits of cloud-based SaaS, including cost reduction and flexibility.
Key components of SaaMES:

SaaS-based MES with MSA and MTA
IoT Edge for real-time data processing and control
Small-scale analytics at the edge for anomaly detection

The paper describes the architecture and implementation of SaaMES, including experiments demonstrating faster real-time processing at the IoT Edge compared to cloud-based analysis.
