This agent-oriented approach becomes pivotal in intelligent network design, essential for resilience and adaptability amid swift changes in traffic behavior and diverse application demands in next-gen networks.

However, the deployment of intelligent agents within resource-constrained environments, a challenge frequently encountered in the Internet of Things (IoT), poses a significant and formidable hurdle. In recognition of this challenge, the present paper introduces the Scalable and Efficient Development Operations (SE-DO) methodology. This methodology is conceived as a comprehensive and strategic approach explicitly designed to enhance the performance of intelligent agents operating within the constraints of resource-restricted environments. By introducing SE-DO, this research responds to the pressing need for sophisticated and adaptive solutions, addressing the inherent difficulties associated with deploying intelligent agents in environments characterized by limited resources.
