Title: Design and Implementation of a Broker-less and Microservice-based IoT Platform

Abstract:
The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized modern technologies by enabling interconnected devices to communicate and share data seamlessly. IoT platforms play a crucial role in facilitating data collection, device management, and remote control functionalities. This paper introduces a novel approach, named BMP (Broker-less and Microservice Platform), which integrates microservices architecture with a broker-less design to enhance scalability, security, and efficiency in IoT applications.

I. Introduction
The paper begins by emphasizing the significance of IoT technologies and outlines the fundamental requirements of IoT platforms: data collection, device and user management, and remote device control. Key considerations such as security, fast data transmission, and energy efficiency are highlighted in meeting these requirements.

II. Background
a. gRPC: Developed by Google, gRPC facilitates the implementation of RPC (Remote Procedure Call) APIs over HTTP/2. It leverages protocol buffers and HTTP/2 support to enable efficient and effective communication.

b. Kafka Message Queue: Kafka is a distributed messaging system designed to support real-time message transfer and minimize message loss.

c. OAuth and Single Sign-On (SSO): OAuth 2.0 is an authentication method that allows applications to access resources without sharing credentials. Single Sign-On (SSO) enables users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications.

d. Microservices Architecture: Microservices are small, independent services combined to build large and scalable applications.

III. Related Work
a. Broker-less Architecture: Studies focus on reducing the use of central brokers in IoT platforms to address data security and scalability challenges.

b. Microservice-based IoT Platforms: Applications of microservices architecture in various domains such as healthcare and agriculture for developing IoT applications.

IV. BMP Architecture
The paper introduces the BMP (Broker-less and Microservice Platform) for IoT applications. BMP aims to enhance inter-device communication and user management by combining microservices and broker-less architecture. The architecture includes detailed layers: Thing, Edge, Cloud, and User layers, each serving specific functions.

V. Implementation
Detailed descriptions of the proposed services and their functionalities are provided. Components such as Single Sign-On (SSO), data collection services (CDC and CDS), and object management service (OMS) are explained, along with their interactions.

VI. Evaluation
The performance and efficiency of BMP deployed on Amazon EC2 are evaluated based on scalability, resilience, and other criteria. The effectiveness and reliability of BMP's functionalities are also tested.

VII. Conclusion and Future Directions
The paper concludes with an assessment of BMP's effectiveness based on its microservices and broker-less architecture. Potential future research directions and enhancements for BMP are discussed, highlighting its contributions and development opportunities.
