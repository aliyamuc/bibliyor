Continuous data streams generated by modern sensed cities open many opportunities for developing new innovative services. Flexible and scalable platforms are needed to ease the design, development, deployment, and operations of new city services. In recent years, several problem-specific platforms have been proposed in different application domains. However, to boost the evolution of smart cities, we need city-oriented platforms that can be easily customized to address different day-to-day life challenges. This paper presents the main architectural challenges and solutions proposed for the design of a novel open-source platform (PROMENADE) characterized by data-driven graph-based modeling support, the dynamic nature of the graph entities updated in real-time from different sources, and high efficiency, scalability, and flexibility to support new city services.

PROMENADE has been built around a general-purpose core that provides a set of built-in standard features such as data ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization exposed as containerized microservices. A specialization of the platform has been developed for road networks monitoring. It has been deployed in OpenShift/Kubernetes and tested using realistic datasets collected from the city of Lyon, France. The analysis addresses an important problem of big data processing pipelines: the synchronization between data ingestion and processing to produce accurate results in useful time. Different approaches for synchronization were studied, and the end-to-end latency is kept under control by leveraging the platform's scalability.

Introduction

As modern cities grow larger and more complex, the adoption of smart solutions for improving day-to-day life, minimizing environmental impacts, and improving sustainability is crucial. The idea of smart cities dates back to the early 1990s, but many challenging problems still need addressing to fully meet these needs. One challenge is defining architectural choices that enable city-dedicated platforms for the continuous deployment of city services as new needs arise. Despite numerous technical solutions for different city problems, there is still a lack of platforms that systematically address a class of problems in a unified way.

Motivation

We consider a smart city as a system of systems, where many constituent systems are networks of entities and relationships that can be modeled using graphs or complex networks. Examples include transportation systems, pedestrian networks, waste management, and smart grids, all of which can be modeled and studied using graphs. These systems can be connected and observed through IoT, with attributes that require adequate big data storage and processing technologies.

This review revealed different platforms proposed to address specific city problems, but these are often difficult to extend for other services. A smart city platform should be designed around three pillars: a modeling layer to abstract diverse city systems, an architectural paradigm for continuous deployment and integration of new functions, and runtime support for large city infrastructures ensuring near real-time responses.

Contribution

This paper contributes to defining a platform as a service (PaaS) for developing smart city services around a common model for complex systems based on graphs. PROMENADE supports agile life-cycle development, deployment, and operations of large-scale smart-city services. The platform provides functionalities such as data ingestion, storage, and computation over graphs that can be managed through a set of services. These services are designed for scalability and real-timeness, and are easily extendable. PROMENADE-v2.0 specializes in road traffic monitoring, representing road networks and related traffic with dynamic graphs. Deployed in OpenShift/Kubernetes, it has been tested with a large-scale dataset of GPS Floating Car Data from Lyon, France, to monitor urban traffic and identify potential vulnerabilities.

Structure of the paper

The paper is divided into nine sections. Section 2 discusses modeling city infrastructures using complex networks. Section 3 outlines the requirements to build a platform like PROMENADE. Section 4 details the platform's architecture. Section 5 describes the implementation of PROMENADE-v2.0 and its extension for road network monitoring. Section 6 covers synchronization patterns for data ingestion and processing. Section 7 assesses PROMENADE-v2.0's scalability and latency. Section 8 reviews related work, and Section 9 concludes the paper and suggests future work.

Complex network modeling of city infrastructures

Cities can be abstracted as dynamic complex networks where nodes represent city entities and links represent their relationships. This model can include multi-layer networks and various types of graphs. The modeling approach can apply to transportation systems, waste management, smart grids, and more, using static and dynamic attributes to describe the system.

Requirements of a platform for managing cities’ complex infrastructures

Cities' complexity requires a unifying meta-model for their infrastructures. Functional requirements include static data upload and update, dynamic data acquisition and storage, data processing support, and data visualization. Non-functional requirements involve time efficiency, availability, scalability, and flexibility. Additional features like data privacy, security, and transaction integrity are also important but are subjects for future implementation.

PROMENADE’s architecture

PROMENADE consists of interconnected microservices divided into four layers and one plane: Initialization and Monitoring Plane (IMP), Stream data Ingestion (SI) and Historical data Ingestion (HI), Distributed Asynchronous Queue (DAQ) and Permanent Storage (PS), Stream Processing (SP) and Batch Processing (BP), and the Service Offering layer (SVC). The platform supports live-stream and historical data ingestion, temporary and permanent storage, and stream and batch processing.

Platform implementation and its specialization in road network monitoring

PROMENADE-v2.0 is implemented with technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Red Hat OpenShift, deployed in a virtualized environment using OpenStack. The platform handles static and dynamic data using Neo4J for static data and MongoDB for dynamic data. Data processing is supported by Apache Spark for general-purpose processing and Neo4J for graph-based processing.

PROMENADE-v2.0 specializes in road traffic monitoring with a graph-based model for road networks. It uses dynamic aggregated data from traffic conditions to compute and analyze road network vulnerabilities.
