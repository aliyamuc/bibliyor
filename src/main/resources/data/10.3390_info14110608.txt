Title: Context-Aware Personalization: A Systems Engineering Framework
Authors: Olurotimi Oguntola and Steven Simske
Abstract:
This study proposes a systems engineering framework for context-aware personalization in e-commerce. The framework combines three components:

Recognition and knowledge of users (persona generation)
Awareness of users' current contexts
Comprehension of users' situations and prediction of future status (intent prediction)

The persona generator uses unsupervised machine learning to assign users to cohorts. The context awareness component is implemented as a microservice. The intent prediction component achieved 97.3% accuracy using BERT embeddings and an LSTM neural network. The framework generates cohort-directed prescriptive actions as recommended alternatives to users' shopping steps.

Introduction


Highlights importance of personalized omnichannel customer experiences in retail
Notes shortage of practical implementations of personalization systems
Proposes a systems engineering framework for context-aware personalization
Framework designed to be simple, scalable and replicable using open-source technology
Implemented through specialized subsystems: persona generation, context awareness, intent prediction, and cohort-directed prescriptions


Materials and Methods

2.1 Data Capture

Uses publicly available e-commerce behavior data
Requires capturing first-party data on user interactions (clicks, searches, views, etc.)
Leverages privacy-compliant methods like device fingerprinting
Data capture layer depicted in system architecture diagram

2.2 Persona Generation

Groups users with similar behavioral metrics into cohorts
Uses unsupervised clustering techniques
Evaluated K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models
Selected K-Means clustering with 5 optimal clusters

2.3 Context-Aware Computing

Acquires contextual information about users' current situations
Implemented as microservices providing various context data
Context variables computed include propensity to purchase, session details, pricing information, etc.

2.4 User Intent Detection

Predicts user's intent during shopping session
Uses LSTM neural network to model sequences of user actions
Experiments with different model architectures and parameters
Best result: 97.3% accuracy using BERT embeddings

2.5 Cohort-Directed Prescription

Generates prescriptive signals for alternative user actions
Based on typical paths of cohort members leading to desired outcomes
Recommends next best action at each step of shopping journey

2.6 Experiments

Used Python, TensorFlow, Keras on Apple M1 chip
Dataset: 22.5 million timestamped events from first month
Compared different model configurations and parameters
Evaluated using metrics like mean absolute error and accuracy


Results


Baseline LSTM model achieved 0.05 MAE on test data
Adding dropout helped reduce overfitting
Best performance: 97.3% accuracy, 0.04 MAE using BERT embeddings


Discussion


Framework enables practical end-to-end implementation of personalization
Modular design allows swapping components as technology improves
Limitations: Could not use actual retail data due to privacy restrictions


Conclusions


Established systems engineering framework for personalized e-commerce
Achieved 97.3% accuracy in predicting user intent
Facilitates improved shopping experiences and business outcomes
Provides scalable, replicable solution for industry practitioners

The paper provides a comprehensive systems engineering approach to implementing context-aware personalization for e-commerce, with promising experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness.
